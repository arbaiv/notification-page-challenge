## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Distinguish between "unread" and "read" notifications
- Select "Mark all as read" to toggle the visual state of the unread notifications and set the number of unread messages to zero
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- JavaScript

### What I learned

I was able to learn and practice arrow function through this project. 

### Continued development

I thought that I could learn to create read & unread functionality through this project and learn some advanced JS concepts, but this project wasn't that challenging. So, I would be taking on some more challenging projects to keep working on my JS.
